# PDF Chatterbox ðŸ’¬

## Project Overview
Ever felt tired of going through the multiple pages of a PDF file and wished that you could fetch your necessary portion without having to spend a lot of time going through the whole document?! Then, here is PDF Chatterbox - a RAG based application to fasten up your information retrieval process from your PDFs. All you have to do is upload one or more PDFs as per your convenience and ask the query you have to the model in order to get the response you are looking for. ![Image Description](https://github.com/Manjit345/PDF-Chatterbox/blob/main/img%201.png)However, make sure that your query is relevant to the context present in your PDF files or it won't be able to generate a proper response. ![Image Description](https://github.com/Manjit345/PDF-Chatterbox/blob/main/img%202.png)
